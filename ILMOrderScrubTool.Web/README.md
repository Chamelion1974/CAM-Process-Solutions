## Development Roadmap

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Foundation complete
- 🚧 **Phase 2**: Order Scrub Module (Current)
- 📋 **Phase 3**: Job Package Management
- 📁 **Phase 4**: Document Control
- 💬 **Phase 5**: Team Collaboration
- 🤖 **Phase 6**: ILM Copilot

## Development Guidelines

### Module Independence
Each module should be self-contained with its own:
- Controllers (API endpoints)
- Services (business logic)
- Models (data structures)
- README (documentation)

### Shared Resources
Common functionality belongs in `/Modules/Shared`:
- Authentication & authorization
- Database context & repositories
- Cross-cutting services
- Utilities & helpers

### Naming Conventions
- Controllers: `{Feature}Controller.cs`
- Services: `I{Feature}Service.cs` and `{Feature}Service.cs`
- Models: Descriptive names (e.g., `Order.cs`, `Job.cs`)
